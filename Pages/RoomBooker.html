    <h1>Meeting Room booking Bot </h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        I'm currently studying at the institution for computer sciences at Stockholm University. 
        It has only been some 10 years since the institution moved to the building that it is currently 
        in. This means that everiything is pretty fresh and modern. However there is a annoying issue. 
        There is no library in the building, and the places where you can sit and study are too few for everyone 
        to be able to have a seat, meaning that you have to get to school very early to get somewhere to sit and 
        study. There is one other option though, and that is to book a meeting room. There are 24 meeting rooms 
        in the building. 6 of them can fit 10 people and the rest fit 5 people each. These meeting rooms are 
        however almost always booked as well. There are some rules that needs to be followed however to book 
        a meeting room, which makes it a bit less likely for them to fill up entierly. For example, you may only 
        book a meeting room for 4 hours per day, you need to be at least 2 people to be able to book it, and 
        you cannot book rooms further into the future than two weeks. I do also believe that there are some 
        restrictions about how many days per week you can book, but I couldn't find any information about that 
        so it is possible that they removed that rule. Since the 2 weeks ahead almost always fill up instantly 
        as soon as you are able too book I thought that I'd make a bot which retrieves information about when 
        which rooms are available and for how long and automatically books the best room.
    </p>

    <p>
        I dont really care which room gets booked since they are pretty much all the same and our group projects 
        sheldom exceeds 5 people. I do however care about the time that gets booked, since the times in the evening 
        are usually free, but there is not much use for me to book a room after 16:00. This may cause an issue 
        when evaluating free times since I would like it to find rooms which can be booked for 4 hours in a row 
        and if there are no ones available it should check for 3 hours etc. But if thats the only rule, it will 
        probably always book a room between 18:00 - 22:00 since they are almost always available. So it needs to 
        want to book a room for as long as possible and as early as possible.

        This is an example of how the rooms are usually booked. Each column represents a room, and each row 1 hour.

    <h2>Plan</h2>
    <p>
        One reason I wanted to take on this project is to learn more about how to use Python. I have a very limited 
        experience in Python since before and wanted to expand on it. I'm planning on using the module <a href="https://pypi.org/project/selenium/" target="_blank">Selenium</a>
        for the web scraping and interaction with the school website. I also plan on translating the data from the booking table into 
        a two dimensional matrix from where the bot can search for available spots. To view the matrix properly I'm also 
        going to use <a href="https://pypi.org/project/numpy/" target="_blank">NumPy</a>. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Exuction</h2>
    <p>
        The first part of coding this project was pretty straight forward. The goal of this part was just to get to the website from
        where schedule could be view. So I basically just used Selenium kind of like a macro program to:<br/><br/>

        * Start Chrome<br/>
        * Go to <a href="https://daisy.dsv.su.se/index.jspa" target="_blank">Daisy</a> (Stockholm University's student web site)<br/>
        * Log in<br/>
        * Open the meeting booking page
    </p>

    <p>
        From here I ran into an issue. The table has a dynamic size based on where the bookings are and how long they are. 
        I thought when entering this page that table always has the number of rooms as columns and the number of rows as 
        hours available. Which would be perfectly translatable to a matrix. So that if someone were to book a meeting in room 
        0 for two hours, it would look something like this, where 1 represents an occupied cell and 0 an available cell: <br/><br/>
    </p>

    <p class="formula">
        [[1, 0, 0...],<br/>
         [1, 0, 0...],<br/>
         [0, 0, 0...]]
    </p>

    <p>
        However when someone books a meeting the cell representing their first hour will expand in length and the second cells 
        on the next row will be removed, making it look like this instead: <br/><br/>
    </p>
    
    <p class="formula">
        [[1, 0, 0...],<br/>
         [0, 0...],<br/>
         [0, 0, 0...]]
    </p>

    <p>
        This means that i cannot just loop through all rows and all columns and setting the ones with blue background to 1 and 
        the ones with white background to 0 beacuase that would result a lot of out of bounds exceptions. I could just use try/except 
        to ignore the cells that don't exist, but that would mean only the first hour of each booking would be translated properly. 
        Fortunatley each booked cell has an id called "rowspan" which is an interger representing how many cells its length should cover 
        and therefore also the amount of hours booked. So for every time the bot encounters a booked cell, it will check its rowspan, 
        and for every iteration of the rowspan it will also mark a cell on the next row as occupied. And when the bot gets to that cell 
        it will ignore it. There is still one major issue with this though and that is that if a cell has been marked as occupied by the 
        cell above it the website treats that cell as it doesn't exists, meaning that if the second cell is occupied, according to 
        the booking site, the third cell would be the second cell so the website gets unsynced with the bot matrix. This is solved by 
        keeping track of all the cells in one row that are occupied by themselves and when finding the cells in later columns, 
        on that row, subtracting the x index by the amount of occupied cells. This will give us an algoritm that looks something like this: 
    </p>

    <p>

        For every row<br/>
        &nbsp &nbsp Set occupied counter to 0<br/>
        &nbsp &nbsp For every column<br/>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If the cell[row][column] in the matrix is not occupied<br/>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If the corresponding cell[row][column - occupied counter] on the website has a blue background<br/>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Find its rowspan<br/>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For every iteration of the rowspan<br/>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Set the cell[row + rowspan iteration][column] to 1<br/>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp else increase occupied counter by 1<br/>

        This is the matrix that has been generated by the data retrieved from the website. <br/>
        And as you can see it represents the picture table from the website displayed above very well.
