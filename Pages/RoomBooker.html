    <h1>Meeting Room booking Bot </h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        I'm currently studying at the institution for computer sciences at Stockholm University. 
        It has only been some 10 years since the institution moved to the building that it is currently 
        in. This means that everiything is pretty fresh and modern. However there is a annoying issue. 
        There is no library in the building, and the places where you can sit and study are too few for everyone 
        to be able to have a seat, meaning that you have to get to school very early to get somewhere to sit and 
        study. There is one other option though, and that is to book a meeting room. There are 24 meeting rooms 
        in the building. 6 of them can fit 10 people and the rest fit 5 people each. These meeting rooms are 
        however almost always booked as well. There are some rules that needs to be followed however to book 
        a meeting room, which makes it a bit less likely for them to fill up entierly. For example, you may only 
        book a meeting room for 4 hours per day, you need to be at least 2 people to be able to book it, and 
        you cannot book rooms further into the future than two weeks. I do also believe that there are some 
        restrictions about how many days per week you can book, but I couldn't find any information about that 
        so it is possible that they removed that rule. Since the 2 weeks ahead almost always fill up instantly 
        as soon as you are able too book I thought that I'd make a bot which retrieves information about when 
        which rooms are available and for how long and automatically books the best room.
    </p>

    <p>
        I dont really care which room gets booked since they are pretty much all the same and our group projects 
        sheldom exceeds 5 people. I do however care about the time that gets booked, since the times in the evening 
        are usually free, but there is not much use for me to book a room after 16:00. This may cause an issue 
        when evaluating free times since I would like it to find rooms which can be booked for 4 hours in a row 
        and if there are no ones available it should check for 3 hours etc. But if thats the only rule, it will 
        probably always book a room between 18:00 - 22:00 since they are almost always available. So it needs to 
        want to book a room for as long as possible and as early as possible.

    <h2>Planning</h2>
    <p>
        One reason I wanted to take on this project is to learn more about how to use Python. I have a very limited 
        experience in Python since before and wanted to expand on it. I'm planning on using the module <a href="https://pypi.org/project/selenium/" target="_blank">Selenium</a>
        for the web scraping and interaction with the school website. I also plan on translating the data from the booking table into 
        a two dimensional matrix from where the bot can search for available spots. To view the matrix properly I'm also 
        going to use <a href="https://pypi.org/project/numpy/" target="_blank">NumPy</a>. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Data collection</h2>
    <p>
        The first part of coding this project was pretty straight forward. The goal of this part was just to get to the website from
        where schedule could be view. So I basically just used Selenium kind of like a macro program to:<br/><br/>

        * Start Chrome<br/>
        * Go to <a href="https://daisy.dsv.su.se/index.jspa" target="_blank">Daisy</a> (Stockholm University's student web site)<br/>
        * Log in<br/>
        * Open the meeting booking page
    </p>

    <p>
        From here I ran into an issue. The table has a dynamic size based on where the bookings are and how long they are. 
        I thought when entering this page that table always has the number of rooms as columns and the number of rows as 
        hours available. Which would be perfectly translatable to a matrix. So that if someone were to book a meeting in room 
        0 for two hours, it would look something like this, where 1 represents an occupied cell and 0 an available cell: <br/><br/>
    </p>

    <p class="formula">
        [[1, 0, 0...],<br/>
         [1, 0, 0...],<br/>
         [0, 0, 0...]]
    </p>

    <p>
        However when someone books a meeting the cell representing their first hour will expand in length and the second cells 
        on the next row will be removed, making it look like this instead: <br/><br/>
    </p>
    
    <p class="formula">
        [[1, 0, 0...],<br/>
         [0, 0...],<br/>
         [0, 0, 0...]]
    </p>

    <p>
        This means that i cannot just loop through all rows and all columns and setting the ones with blue background to 1 and 
        the ones with white background to 0 beacuase that would result a lot of out of bounds exceptions. I could just use try/except 
        to ignore the cells that don't exist, but that would mean only the first hour of each booking would be translated properly. 
        Fortunatley each booked cell has an id called "rowspan" which is an interger representing how many cells its length should cover 
        and therefore also the amount of hours booked. So for every time the bot encounters a booked cell, it will check its rowspan, 
        and for every iteration of the rowspan it will also mark a cell on the next row as occupied. And when the bot gets to that cell 
        it will ignore it. There is still one major issue with this though and that is that if a cell has been marked as occupied by the 
        cell above it the website treats that cell as it doesn't exists, meaning that if the second cell is occupied, according to 
        the booking site, the third cell would be the second cell so the website gets unsynced with the bot matrix. This is solved by 
        keeping track of all the cells in one row that are occupied by themselves and when finding the cells in later columns, 
        on that row, subtracting the x index by the amount of occupied cells. This will give us an algoritm that looks something like this: 
    </p>

    <p>

        For every row<br/>
        &nbsp &nbsp Set occupied counter to 0<br/>
        &nbsp &nbsp For every column<br/>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If the cell[row][column] in the matrix is not occupied<br/>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If the corresponding cell[row][column - occupied counter] on the website has a blue background<br/>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Find its rowspan<br/>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For every iteration of the rowspan<br/>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Set the cell[row + rowspan iteration][column] to 1<br/>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp else increase occupied counter by 1<br/>

        This is the matrix that has been generated by the data retrieved from the website. <br/>
        And as you can see it represents the picture table from the website displayed above very well.
    </p>

    <h2>Data evaluation</h2>
    <p>
        After successfully retrieving the reservation data from te website and translating it to the matrix, 
        The next step was to evaluate that matrix and find a room that could be booked for as long as possible 
        and as close to, or preferrably covering a preferred start time which is entered when starting the program. 
        To do so I developed the following algorithm and implemented it:
    </p>

    <p class="formula">RESERVATION_MATCH = (AVAILABLE_HOURS - ⌊e <sup>|PREFERRED_TIME - ACTUAL_TIME|</sup> / 10⌋ ) / 0.04</p>

    <p>
        The reservation match is the extent to which a booking matches my preferences measured in percentage. The first occurence of 
        a 100 %  match will be booked, and if no 100 % match is found, the higher the percentage, the higher the possibility of it 
        being booked. The way it works is that the bot loops over all of the spots in the matrix and for every spot it checks how 
        many cells below the current one that are 0. The check caps at four available cells, so if one column has 5 available cells 
        in a row, it still only counts as 4 since that is the maximum length of a reservation. A problem would arise if the bot 
        only were to check for the most available cells in a column. That is that the reservations would always be made in the evening
        since there are rarely any rooms available for 4 hours straight earlier during the day. So I wanted the program to be able to 
        reserve a room that was only available for 3 hours or sometimes even 2 if it was closer to my preferred reservation time than 
        a reservation that would be available for 4 hours. So I started by subtracting the absoulte difference between the preferred time 
        and the actual time of the current cell. So that if the actual time is 2 hours after the preferred time it would be equaly as 
        likely to book that room as if the actual time was 2 hours before the preferred time. After this step, the program would be 
        equaly likely to reserve a room from the preferred time for 3 hours as a room for 4 hours with a reservation that starts 1 hour 
        before or after the preferred time, as well as booking a room on the preferred time for 2 hours as booking a room for 4 hours 
        with a reservation that starts 2 hours before or after the preferred time. This is not quite what I want, because I am somewhat 
        flexible so I could get in a few hours earlier or later if it would mean that I could use the room for 4 hours.
    </p>

    <p>
        Instead I would like the program to be less likely to book a room the larger the difference between the preferred time and actual 
        time. Enter: Exponentiation. By using Euler's number as a base and the absolute differnce between the actual time and the preferred 
        time and dividing it by 10 I found that balance between how long the reservation is and how far from my preferred start time it is 
        corresponds well to how I would make my decision. I then floored the right hand side of the operation so that the reservation match 
        does not get higher with shorter reservations on the correct time than longer reservations on a later or earlier time by default 
        because of some decimal. The current value is then divided by 0.04 which is basically a division by 100 to get the percentage and then 
        multiplied by the maximum hours of a reservation (4). When every cell has been awarded a reservation match percentage, the cell with 
        the highest percentage will be set as the start point for the reservation that is about to be made. The number of free cells below 
        it is also stored in a variable to know for how long the room can be reserved. This algorithm works very well in practice and I have 
        used it a lot, howerver if I had more time to work on it I would make some revisions, because of an issue with the exponentiation. 
        If the difference between the preferred time gets high enough, say that the preferred reservation time is 09:00 and the cell being 
        evaluated is at 18:00, the exponentiation would be extremely high, and when being subtracted from the available hours the reservation 
        match would result in a negative number. In practice this means that the room will never be booked at that time, which is the expected 
        and wanted outcome and therefore is not a problem, but I would like for the reservation match to always represent a probability of the 
        room being booked. So if I was to work on this further, I would make the reservation match always be a value between 0-100, and the 
        example mentioned above would result in an extremely low positive number instead of a negative one.
    </p>

    <h2>Making the reservation</h2>
    <p>
        The last step is to make the reservation which is just as straight forward as the first step. By using Selenium for web interaction, 
        the bot can just fill out the form and enter all the nessescary information gathered in earlier steps, and then the program is complete.
        To make it a bit more exciting, I implemented the use of the <a href="https://www.twilio.com/sms" target="_blank">Twilio SMS API</a> so that when the 
        reservation is done, a text message is sent to my phone number with the details of the reservation.
