    <h1>Penetration Testing</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        About half a year ago I took a class in computer science in school. It was 
        a pretty general course that covered the basics of different securty areas 
        such as encryption and personal computer security as well as on a society level.
        It requiered now prior knowledge in the field and it was by far the most interesting 
        course that I have taken since I started University about 3 years ago. 
        It probably had to do a lot with how involved the teachers were through out the 
        entire course, but I also found the topic of computer security extremely fascinating 
        and I could not understand how I had studied computer sciences for about 2.5 years 
        without even touching on the subject of security when it is such an important topic 
        and it affects basically every level of computer sciences. Since then I decided that 
        this is the field I would like to have a career in. More specifically I have become really 
        interested in penetration testing. I wouldn't hide that a contributing factor to this is 
        (probably not unlike other people) my love for the TV series Mr. Robot. However I actually started 
        watching the show after my interest in pentesting was born. So the show might be of 
        a source of motivation, but it is not the foundation for my entire commitment. I actually 
        got interested in penetration testing because it appears to be a way to gain knowledge of 
        the ways computer systems are built. Digging into deeper layers of systems and how software 
        is architectured has been a great fascination and aspiration since I first learned to code. 
        I want sometime in the future to build a compiler for my own programming language, because that 
        so many layers deep into understanding the way of systems that it feels like a true acomplishment.
        
        <br/><br/>
        
        I have found it pretty difficult to get into pentesting, since it is a new type of working, and 
        it requires some resources such as hackable targets etc. I've found some good websites such as 
        <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/">HackTheBox</a> to help with that, and I have tried out some 
        different machines and followed tutorials, but still not been able to gain access to ANY machine. 
        I reckon this is because the tutorials just explain every step they take but have a tendency to fail 
        in explaining the thought process behind it and why they are doing certain things. So determined to 
        make some progress I decided to google for best introductary books to pentesting, and my eyes landed 
        on Metasploit: The Penetration Tester's Guide by Kennedy, D et al. And the process from here on is 
        that I will write a little summary in blog post format on what I've learnt and how that can be useful 
        after each chapter I read.

    <h2>1: The Absolute Basics of Penetration Testing</h2>
    <p>
        So as far as this chapter went, I felt like I at least had gained some knowledge of how pentesting works 
        but I would not be exaggerate if I said that my knowledge does not go much further than what was explained 
        in this chapter. However I already noticed that there are some information that are typical textbook knowledge 
        and probably won't help me in the practical approach of pentesting but I really enjoy, because it makes me feel 
        initiated in the process and understand the bigger picture. An example of this is that companies often use two 
        different types of penetration testing: overt and covert. Where covert testing basically simulates a real attack 
        very well. The owner of the target machines are usually not aware when an attack is about to take place and how it 
        will be done. Whereas an overt attack is a simulated attack where the attacker has corresponance with the owner 
        of the target and they share information about the target throughout the process instead of the pentester having 
        to research the target. The perks of using a covert attack is of course that it is very similar to what would 
        happen in a real attack, but it is also much more time and and expence intensive than an overt attack. This 
        is knowledge that I find really helpful to understand the entire process, but I would probably not stumble upon 
        it outside of a true textbook.

        <br/><br/>

        A habit that I realise that I've had when trying to gain access to the HackTheBox machines after reading this 
        chapter is that I am not nearly as precise when choosing an exploit to fit the target. I google some exploits 
        that appears to have worked on a similar system in the past and then I just try all the exploits, one by one. 
        When I read the sentence: "Blindly firing off a mass onslaught of exploits and praying for a shell isn't productive"
        (Kennedy et al., 2011) I almost started laughing because that is so on point what I have been doing when trying 
        to hack the machines. So I want to get a more investigative approach to the way that I go about hacking in the 
        future. This also sounds to me like a much more elegant approach, to gain so much knowledge about a system that 
        you almost certainly only will have to try and exploit it once. And I'm all in for elegance. It also sounds to 
        a novice pentester such as myself that this will make it harder for the target system to decect my "malicious" 
        intents. This does of course include vulnerability scanners as well as exploits. Using something like Nmap to 
        scan all ports on a machine and getting results is very satisfactory for me who don't have a lot of experience, 
        but I'd like to learn how to do that the custom way, and know before mapping the network what ports are most 
        likely to be open because I already learnt in the intelligence gathering fase what type of machine the target is.

        <br/><br/>

        Another thing I take with me from this chapter, which I already enjoy a lot and probably would have spent a lot 
        of time doing anyway is documenting the process. This is by far one of the most important ways for me to grasp 
        and remember something. It does take a lot of time. Time that I could have spent experimenting, but I have learnt 
        through the years that this is almost the most important part for me to actually gain something from the experience.

        <br/><br/>

        To conclude this chapter I would say that the thing I will have to work on the most is precision when it comes 
        to actively do something to the target. I know a big piece of penetration testing is brute forcing, but this 
        part should not be. Also automation is great for easing the process when trying to learn, but a lot of details 
        can be overseen and to fully understand, the best way is to deep dive.
