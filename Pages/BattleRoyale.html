    <h1>Battle Royale</h1>
    <h2>Initial overview of the game</h2>
    <p>
        This is a work in progress Battle Royale game that is supposed to have different game modes 
        such as capture the flag and last man standing. Currently the only game mode is most kills on time.
        My vision is that you will be able to select a hero with a different weapon and a special ability 
        and level it up and then there will be a scoreboard constantly updating so that if you'd want to 
        remain at the top you would have to continue playing the game. I've taken a lot of inspiration from 
        Overwatch and still haven't found a niche for this game, or even a general theme, but my hopes are 
        that the more I develop the game, the better picutre I'm going to have of the end result. 
        I started the process of developing this game in January 2020 a couple of days after new years.
        I got the idea after having played a bit of Overwatch durring the holidays and thought that it would 
        be nice to work on a project that was multiplayer and based on shorter rounds since that would remove
        the hassle of developing believable NPCs and the level design and story would not have to be spent as
        much time on. Every solo game developer that has thought about creating their own game has experienced
        that these 3 areas of development is what makes scope unmanagable. So I though that if I were to 
        eliminate those areas, maybe I would be able to complete an entire game on my own. However I dont have much
        experience in network programing, I've only been playing around with <a href="https://github.com/RevenantX/LiteNetLib" target="_blank">LiteNetLib</a> 
        a bit before, and I think that I should be able to do something with it since it's basically the same as I tried before 
        but in a larger scale.
    </p>

    <p>
        When I started the new project I knew that I wanted t ohave a first person view because I liked that in Overwatch 
        and I've also been playing a bit of Star Wars: Battlefront 2 where you have the possibility to toggle betweeen first 
        person and over shoulder view and I strongly prefer the first person view there as well. Aditionally I also thought 
        that I would save time on going with the first person view since I wouldn't need the entire mesh on the players character, 
        which also meant that I would not have to animate it. So I started by adding the First person controller from the Unity Standard 
        Assets. However I had to change this later on because I wanted to have a ragdoll effect showing when you die, and for 
        that I need a characer mesh. So I created my own firs person controller using the characer controller component. This went 
        pretty smooth but since I did not use Rigidbody as I was used to doing I had some issues with jumping and falling physics. 
        However after searching the web for help, I found <a href="https://medium.com/ironequal/unity-character-controller-vs-rigidbody-a1e243591483" target="_blank">this article</a> 
        on differences between using rigidbodies and character controllers and it helped me a lot. After tweaking the values a bit 
        it now feels good.
    </p>

    <p>
        When creating the weapon system I wanted to make it generalized so that I would later be able to add weapons that I was currently 
        not considering, so I made a Weapon script with a virtual method called attack which could be overridden, but still is executed by either 
        clicking the left mouse button if the enum shoot type is set to single or hold the button if it is set to continous. I also wanted the shots 
        to hurt more if they hit a critical body part and if the weapon was fired within a preferred range and if the range exceeded the preferred range 
        each weapon would have a different falloff. For example a sniper rifle would do equally as much harm if it was fired from 100 m as if it was fired 
        from 20 m while a shotgun might only make 10 % of the damage if it was fired from a 100 m but do full damage if it was fired from 20 m. 
        I've been assuming while doing this that every character will have a max health of 100 units and each body part has a multiplier between 0-1. 
        Meaning that if you hit another player with a shot whitin the preferred range on a body part that has the multipler value of 1, which currently 
        only is the head, that player dies instantly. The actual damage given by a shot is calculated with the formula below and clamped between 0 - FullWeaponDamage: 
    </p>


    <p class="formula">
        FullWeaponDamage - (Distance - PreferredDistance) * (Falloff / 100) * BodypartMultiplier
    </p>

    <p>
        The special abilities pretty much work the same way as the weapons, but with other functionality. They are connected to the E key and runs a virtual method when 
        it is pressed. For now I have only implemented one special ability which is a gerappling hook. It is a pretty basic implementation that makes a raycast from 
        the gun to a specified distance in front of the player. If the raycast hits any object tagged as walkable, it creates a line renderer between the player and that 
        impact point and pulls the player towards it. When the player gets within a certain distance of that point the character gets a small physics push upwards. I implemented 
        that jump in the end beacause I found it very dificult to get on top of objects when you couldn't raycast to tehe top of them. You don't have to reach the exact point 
        of the ray hit beacuse that is almost impossible and would probably lead to the character being dragged to that point for the rest of the game.

        As stated earlier probably the largest and most important part of this game is the multiplayer and network aspect. Without multiplayer, it would not be a game at all, 
        it would just be a simulation where you can walk around shooting dummies, which does not sound like a lot of fun. So I realized that I would have to implement 
        the network functionality early on because that was the part I was unsure about if I could manage. So I started working on the server - client infrastructure. 
        The server is done in C# as well, but it is a separate console project done with .NET and not Unity. I made an enum that specifies the type of the packet 
        that is sent, so every time a packet is recieved from either the server or the client, the first thing that it checks is what type of packet it is and 
        then sends the rest of the information to the part of the code dealing with that specific feature. For example if Player 1 shoots Player 2, the Player 1 calculates 
        how much damage it has done, it then sends a packet with the damage to the server which tells Player 2 how much damage has been dealt. Player 2 then checks if it 
        has died, if so, it then sends a new packet with that information to the server which then tells Player 1 that she successfully killed Player 2.

        I want a lot of the environment to be breakable so that it seems more dynamic in a gunfight. To do so I created an interface called IBreakable 
        which can be implemented in any object. The interface only contains one method which is to break. Currently the objects only break when they're 
        being shot at, but in the future I want them to break from fall damage etc. I'm using the interface in example cubes for now that, have been 
        divided into segments in blender and when the interface method is called, a rigidbody is applied to each segment and for each segment a random 
        force between a negative pushforce from the weapon and the same absolute force, this makes the breaking of every cube seem a little different.

        This is what it looks like when the IBreakable interface is used.

        As I said before, I've also added ragdoll effect to the players when they die. I did this by using Unity's ragdoll creation tool, and by default 
        disabled the gravity and enabled kinematic of each rigidbody. When the player dies I swap these values making gravity enabled and isKinematic disabled. 
        Then I add a force to each rigidbody pushing the player away from where the shot came from with the force set on the weapon.
